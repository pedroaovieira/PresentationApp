### JSON Presentation Import

Allow the user to import a JSON file that defines a phase per slide, each with its own duration and colour. The timer would advance automatically through phases as the presenter moves through slides — no manual configuration needed.

**Proposed JSON format**

```json
{
  "title": "My Conference Talk",
  "slides": [
    { "slide": 1, "title": "Introduction",   "duration_seconds": 120, "color": "#5AF0B3", "message": "Introduction" },
    { "slide": 2, "title": "Problem",        "duration_seconds": 180, "color": "#5AF0B3", "message": "Problem statement" },
    { "slide": 3, "title": "Solution",       "duration_seconds": 240, "color": "#FFB95F", "message": "Solution" },
    { "slide": 4, "title": "Demo",           "duration_seconds": 300, "color": "#FFB95F", "message": "Live demo" },
    { "slide": 5, "title": "Conclusion",     "duration_seconds": 60,  "color": "#FFCAC5", "message": "Wrap up!" }
  ]
}
```

**Behaviour**
- Total timer duration = sum of all `duration_seconds`
- Each slide maps to a phase; the app tracks which slide is active based on elapsed time
- A **"Next slide"** tap advances to the next phase instantly (the remaining time for the current slide is discarded or carried over — TBD)
- The colour and message for each slide come from the JSON, not from the global phase thresholds
- A slide indicator (e.g. "Slide 3 / 5") is shown on screen

**Implementation notes**
- Add an **Import** button on the setup screen (next to the gear icon)
- Use Android's `ActivityResultContracts.GetContent` with `application/json` MIME type to open the file picker
- Parse with `org.json` (already available) or `kotlinx.serialization`
- Validate: every slide must have `duration_seconds > 0` and a valid hex colour
- Store the imported plan separately from the manually configured phases (do not overwrite user's phases)
- Show a preview of the imported plan before starting (slide count, total duration)

## Ideas / Wishlist

- **Export phases as JSON** — let users back up and share their phase configurations
- **Haptic feedback** — vibrate on phase change
- **Tablet / landscape layout** — wider timer with side panel for slide list
- **Tablet split-screen** — run timer alongside presentation notes
