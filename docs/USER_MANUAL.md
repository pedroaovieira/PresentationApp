## 1. Overview

**PresentationTimer** is a full-screen countdown timer designed for speakers and presenters. A coloured accent bar across the top of the screen — and a matching progress bar and status label — show exactly where you stand at a single glance, without interrupting your flow.

The design is dark and cinematic: a deep `#131313` background keeps the focus on the clock, while a 4 dp aura bar and a thin linear progress bar smoothly cross-fade between phase colours as time passes.

Out of the box there are three phases (mint green → amber → coral), but you can add as many as you like and customise the colour, threshold, and message of each one.

That's it.

## 4. Timer Screen

### 4.1 Setup

<img src="screenshots/01_setup.png" width="240" alt="Setup screen">

When you first open the app you see the **setup screen**:

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **TEMPORAL** (top centre) | App brand name |
| Gear icon (top-right) | Opens the phase settings |
| **SET THE PACE** headline | Large editorial heading in the centre |
| **HH : MM : SS** fields | Enter your desired duration |
| **INITIALIZE** button | Begins the countdown |

**Enter your time:** Tap each field (HH, MM, SS) and type the number. You only need to fill the fields you use — e.g., type `25` in MM for a 25-minute talk.

---

### 4.2 Running

<img src="screenshots/02_green.png" width="240" alt="Running — green phase">

While the timer is running:

- The **aura bar** (4 dp strip at the very top) glows the active phase colour.
- The **status label** below the brand name shows the phase message in the phase colour.
- The **countdown** is shown in large digits at the centre.
- The **linear progress bar** below the countdown sweeps down as time passes.

Phase colour transitions are animated with a 500 ms cross-fade — smooth and unobtrusive.

**Controls while running:**

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| **Pause** (large circle) | Freezes the countdown. |
| **Reset** (small dark circle) | Cancels the timer and returns to the setup screen. |

---

### 4.3 Paused

When paused the aura bar and status label stay the colour of the phase you paused in, and the label changes to **"PAUSED"**. The **Resume** button appears — tap it to continue.

---

### 4.4 Time's Up

<img src="screenshots/05_finished.png" width="240" alt="Finished">

When the countdown reaches zero:

- The timer **flashes** to grab your attention.
- The status label reads **"TIME'S UP"**.
- The aura bar holds the colour of the last active phase.
- Tap **Reset** to go back to setup.

---

## 5. Configuring Phases

### 5.1 Opening Settings

Tap the **gear icon** in the top-right corner of the setup screen. The phases editor opens.

> The settings button is only visible on the setup screen (not while a timer is running).

---

### 5.2 Editing a Phase

<img src="screenshots/06_settings.png" width="240" alt="Settings screen">

Each phase is shown as a dark card with four editable fields:

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Phase name** | A label for your own reference (not shown during the timer). |
| **Active when ≥ X% remaining** | The minimum percentage of time remaining for this phase to be active. For example, `50` means this phase shows when more than half the time is left. |
| **Message** | The text shown at the top of the screen while this phase is active. |
| **Background color** | Tap any colour swatch to select it. The selected colour is highlighted with a white ring. |

All fields save automatically when you press **Save** or navigate back.

---

### 5.3 Adding a Phase

<img src="screenshots/07_settings_add.png" width="240" alt="Add phase">

Tap the green **+** button (bottom-right) to add a new phase card. A default card appears at the bottom of the list — edit its name, threshold, message, and colour just like any other phase.

**Example — adding a "Wrap up" phase:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phase name | Wrap up |
| Active when ≥ | 10 |
| Message | Start wrapping up! |
| Colour | Orange |

This phase would appear during the last 10% of your presentation time.

---

### 5.4 Deleting a Phase

Tap the **red trash icon** in the top-right of any phase card to delete it.

> At least one phase must remain. If only one phase exists, the trash icon is dimmed and cannot be tapped.

---

### 5.5 Saving Changes

Tap **Save** in the toolbar, or simply press the **back** button. A "Phases saved" message will confirm the save. Changes take effect immediately — the next timer you start will use the updated phases.

---

## 6. Phase Logic Explained

Phases are sorted by their threshold, highest first. During the timer, the app picks the **first phase whose threshold is ≤ the current remaining percentage**.

**Example with three phases:**

| Phase | Threshold | Active when |
|---|---|---|
| On track | 50% | Remaining ≥ 50% |
| Hurry up | 20% | Remaining ≥ 20% (and < 50%) |
| Almost done | 0% | Remaining < 20% |

**Tips for setting thresholds:**

- The **lowest threshold** (usually `0`) is the fallback — it is always shown when no higher phase matches.
- Thresholds must be between **0** and **100**.
- You can have as many phases as you like (e.g., 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%).
- There is no need for the thresholds to be evenly spaced.

## 7. Tips for Presenters

- **Keep it simple:** The default three phases (mint green → amber → coral) work for most talks. Only customise if you have a specific need.
- **Use the aura bar:** The coloured strip at the top is visible even in bright rooms and from a distance — you don't need to read the digits.
- **Screen brightness:** Turn your phone brightness to maximum before your talk so the accent colour is clearly visible.
- **Don't cover the screen:** Lay the phone flat or prop it at an angle. The display stays on automatically.
- **Long presentations:** For talks over an hour, enter the hours in the **HH** field. The time display switches to `H:MM:SS` format automatically.
- **Custom messages:** If you are timing a panel or multiple speakers, set messages like "5 min left" or "Wrap up now" that make sense for your context.
